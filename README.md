**What the Software Does**

Our program takes in the user's name and date of birth. It then outputs using that information the zodiac sign of the user.

**How to Use the Program**
- Make sure you have python installed.
- Download the program.
- Navigate a terminal to the folder the program is installed in.
- execute: "python something.py"

**Why we Chose our Code of Conduct and License**

We choose an academic free license beause our code doesn't really have any major use and it is pretty simple, so we would want to share it with the most
amount of people as well as let them use and edit our program.

We choose a code of conduct that allowed user for a free experience but was strict on the misuse of the product.
