**Why we Chose our Code of Conduct and License**

We chose a free license that we found online because our program isnt really that useful, so we wanted to share it with a lot of people and they should be allowed to use and edit their program.

Our code of conduct allows a user to use the program for free but is strict on the misuse of the product.
